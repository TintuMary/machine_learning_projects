Anomaly Detection:

Outlier Detection: when input contains both standard and outlier without output label (unsupervised learning). Aim is to group input data into two buckets (standard and outlier data) 

Novelty detection: when input contains only standard (normal) data along with output label (supervised learning) and trained model has to identify any outlier item during testing

Identify Anomaly in data by:
a.	Standard deviataion
b.	Box plot for continuous attributes
c.	Isolation Forest
d.	Amazon Robust Random Cut forest algorithm 
e.	DBScan Clustering, K-means, hierarchal clustering etc
